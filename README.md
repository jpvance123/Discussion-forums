## ⚠️ Academic Integrity & Intellectual Property  

This repository is **not an attempt to disseminate course materials**. All content within these markdown files represents my **own intellectual property**, consisting solely of my personal insights, analyses, and responses from the discussion forums.  

- I will **not** be providing the original discussion forum questions, in strict accordance with the **MBA Honor Code**.  
- These submissions reflect my **own thoughts and reflections**, not copied or sourced from any other student or external material.  
- The repository exists solely as a **personal learning tool** and **demonstration of AI-assisted content structuring**—not for distribution of course content.
